# Problem: Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

## Description
Given two strings `s` and `t`, find the **length** of their **longest common subsequence**.  
A **subsequence** of a string is a sequence that can be derived from the string by deleting some (possibly zero) characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

---

## Input
- First line: string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 2000).  
- Second line: string `t` (1 ≤ |t| ≤ 2000).  
- Strings contain only lowercase English letters.

## Output
One integer — the length of the LCS of `s` and `t`.

## Sample

### Input
```
abcde
ace
```

### Output
```
3
```

---

## Explanation
One LCS is `ace` with length 3.
