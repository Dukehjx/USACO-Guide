# Day 17 – Bronze Level Review Problems (Binary Search & Prefix Sum)

Today is a review and practice day!  
You’ll solve real contest-style problems using **binary search** and **prefix sums**—the two major topics from this week.

## 📌 What You'll Do

- Practice applying binary search and prefix sum to USACO-style problems
- Review and reinforce these essential techniques
- Build speed and confidence for harder contest problems

## 📝 How to Practice

1. **Read each problem statement carefully.**
2. **Decide which technique to use**—binary search or prefix sums?
3. **Plan your code**: Write comments or pseudocode first.
4. **Code and test with the sample input/output.**
5. **Check for off-by-one and edge case errors.**
6. **Review:** Can you solve it more efficiently?

## 💡 Example

See [`example.cpp`](./example.cpp) for a problem combining prefix sums and binary search.

## 📝 Tips

- Use prefix sums for fast range queries.
- Use binary search for “find the first/last value with a property.”
- Practice writing helper functions to make code neat.


## 🏋️‍♂️ Review Problem
