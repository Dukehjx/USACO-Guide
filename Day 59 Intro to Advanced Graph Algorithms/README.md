# Day 59 – Introduction to Advanced Graph Algorithms

## Overview
Today we begin studying **advanced graph algorithms** that are essential for USACO Gold-level problems and beyond.

---

## Key Topics
1. **Weighted Graphs** – Edges have weights (cost, distance, time).  
2. **Shortest Path Algorithms**  
   - Dijkstra’s Algorithm (non-negative weights).  
   - Bellman-Ford Algorithm (handles negative weights).  
   - Floyd-Warshall (all-pairs shortest path).  
3. **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**  
   - Kruskal’s Algorithm.  
   - Prim’s Algorithm.  

---

## Applications
- Road networks (shortest path).  
- Network design (MST).  
- Dynamic programming on graphs.

## Learning Goals
- Understand the difference between unweighted and weighted graphs.  
- Learn core shortest path algorithms.  
- Prepare for detailed study of **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** tomorrow.

## Next Steps
Tomorrow (Day 60), we will study **Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm** in detail.
