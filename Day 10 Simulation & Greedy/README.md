# Day 10 – Bronze Practice Problems (Simulation & Greedy)

Congratulations on reaching Day 10!  
Today, you’ll **apply your new skills** with real USACO-style practice problems focused on **simulation** and **greedy** techniques.

---

## 📌 What You'll Do

- Solve a simulation practice problem
- Solve a greedy practice problem
- Practice reading, analyzing, and coding USACO-style problems
- Review solutions and compare different approaches

---

## 📝 How to Practice

1. **Read each problem statement carefully.**
2. **Identify which technique to use:**  
   - Does it need step-by-step modeling? (Simulation)
   - Can you always take the local best option? (Greedy)
3. **Plan your code:** Write comments or pseudocode if helpful.
4. **Code your solution and test with the sample input/output.**
5. **Check time and space complexity**—will your code be efficient enough?
6. **Review:** Try to improve your code or solve it with another method.

## 💡 Example

See [`example.cpp`](./example.cpp) for a simulation solution to a simple “race” problem.

## 📝 Tips

- For simulation: Track each change step by step. Be careful with indexes and updates.
- For greedy: Try proving why your greedy choice is always optimal.
- Practice writing clear, organized code (helpful for debugging!).

## 🏋️‍♂️ Practice Problems

Solve the simulation problem in [`problem.md`](./problem.md), then try creating your own greedy problem and code it as extra practice!

> Good luck! You’re building real USACO skills now.
