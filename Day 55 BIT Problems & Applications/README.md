# Day 55 – BIT Problems & Applications

## Overview
Yesterday we learned the basics of **Fenwick Trees (BITs)**.  
Today we apply BITs to solve real competitive programming problems.

---

## Common Applications
1. **Range Sum Queries with Point Updates**  
   - Classic BIT usage.  

2. **Counting Inversions in an Array**  
   - Use BIT to count how many smaller elements come after each element.  

3. **Frequency Counting / Order Statistics**  
   - BIT can be used as a frequency array to answer "how many numbers ≤ x".  

4. **2D BITs**  
   - Extend the idea to grids for range queries in 2D.

## Learning Goals
- Solve practical problems using BIT.  
- Implement **inversion counting** with BIT.  
- Understand how BIT can handle frequency and order statistics.

## Next Steps
Tomorrow (Day 56), we will simulate a **Silver-Level Contest**.
