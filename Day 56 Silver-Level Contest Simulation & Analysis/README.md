# Day 56 – Silver-Level Contest Simulation & Analysis

## Overview
Today we simulate a **USACO Silver-level contest**.  
The goal is to practice solving problems under contest conditions, then analyze solutions.

---

## Contest Setup
- **Time Limit**: 4 hours (like USACO).  
- **Problems**: 3-4 problems of Silver difficulty.  
- **Topics Covered**:  
  - Two-Pointer / Sliding Window  
  - DFS / BFS on Graphs  
  - Dynamic Programming  
  - Prefix Sums / Range Queries  

---

## Strategy During Contest
1. **Skim all problems** – identify easy/medium ones.  
2. **Implement carefully** – avoid small bugs.  
3. **Test with sample cases first**.  
4. **Manage time** – don’t get stuck too long on one problem.

## Post-Contest Analysis
- Review problem editorial.  
- Compare multiple approaches.  
- Learn from mistakes and inefficiencies.

## Learning Goals
- Gain real contest experience.  
- Improve speed and accuracy.  
- Learn structured post-contest review.

## Next Steps
Tomorrow (Day 57), we move into **Introduction to Gold Division**.
