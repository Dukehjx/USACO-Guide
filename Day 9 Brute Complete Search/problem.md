# Self-Test Problem: All Triplets with a Target Sum

**Statement:**  
Given N integers and a target value T, count how many distinct triplets (i, j, k) with i < j < k satisfy arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k] = T.

---

**Input Format:**  
First line: two integers N and T (1 ≤ N ≤ 100, |T| ≤ 10⁶)  
Second line: N integers arr[1..N]

**Output Format:**  
A single integer: the number of valid triplets

---

**Sample Input:**
```
5 7
2 3 2 1 4
```

**Sample Output:**
```
2
```

*Explanation: The triplets (2, 3, 2) and (2, 1, 4) sum to 7.*
