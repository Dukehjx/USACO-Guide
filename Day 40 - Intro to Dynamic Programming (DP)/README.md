# Day 40 – Introduction to Dynamic Programming (DP)

## Overview
Today we begin learning about **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, one of the most important techniques in USACO Silver/Gold and higher-level contests.

### What is DP?
Dynamic Programming is a method to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems, storing the results, and reusing them to avoid repeated work.

### Key Concepts
1. **Overlapping Subproblems** – Problems can be divided into subproblems that appear multiple times.
2. **Optimal Substructure** – The solution can be built using optimal solutions of smaller subproblems.
3. **Memoization** – Store results of recursive calls in a table (top-down DP).
4. **Tabulation** – Build results iteratively in a table (bottom-up DP).

## Learning Goals
- Understand the **definition** of DP.
- Learn the **memoization technique** (top-down recursion with memory).
- Get comfortable with **transition relations**.

## Next Steps
In Day 41, we will practice with **Fibonacci and Grid Paths**.
