# Day 47 â€“ DP Problem Set & Practice

## Overview
Today is focused on **solving a set of practice problems** that reinforce what we learned about dynamic programming (DP).  
We will practice with problems involving:
- Fibonacci variations
- Grid paths with obstacles
- Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
- Knapsack variants

---

## Strategy for Practice
1. **Identify subproblems**: What smaller problems does this reduce to?
2. **Define DP state**: Represent the solution with clear state variables.
3. **Find transitions**: How do you move from smaller states to bigger ones?
4. **Check base cases**: Initialize carefully to avoid errors.
5. **Optimize if possible**: Consider memory/time improvements.

## Learning Goals
- Apply DP knowledge to a variety of problems.  
- Strengthen problem-solving intuition.  
- Recognize common DP problem types.

## Next Steps
Tomorrow (Day 48), we will move into **advanced prefix sums** and their optimizations.
