## 📌 What You'll Learn

- What is competitive programming?
- Introduction to USACO (USA Computing Olympiad)
- Contest format and divisions
- Basic problem-solving strategies

## 🧑‍💻 Introduction

Competitive programming is a mental sport where you solve well-defined algorithmic problems as quickly and accurately as possible. It improves your coding skills, logical thinking, and helps prepare for exams and technical interviews.

**USACO** is one of the world’s most recognized programming contests for high school students. It has four divisions: **Bronze**, **Silver**, **Gold**, and **Platinum**. You’ll advance through the ranks by solving problems and submitting correct solutions.

## 🏆 About USACO

- **Website:** [usaco.org](http://usaco.org)
- **Languages:** C++, Java, Python (we focus on C++)
- **Divisions:** Start in Bronze; move up by passing contests
- **Contest Format:** 3–4 problems per contest, 4 hours to solve
- **Input/Output:** Usually via standard input/output or files

---

## 📝 Problem Solving Strategy

1. **Understand the Problem:** Carefully read and make sure you know what is being asked.
2. **Identify Input/Output:** Write down the format.
3. **Find Patterns:** Break down the problem, look for patterns or rules.
4. **Plan Solution:** Write a step-by-step approach or pseudocode.
5. **Implement:** Code your solution in C++.
6. **Test:** Use sample input/output and try edge cases.
7. **Debug:** Fix errors and refine.
