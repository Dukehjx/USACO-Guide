# Day 53 â€“ Segment Tree Problems & Practice

## Overview
Today we practice solving **Segment Tree problems** to strengthen our understanding.  
We will implement and solve problems involving:
- Range Sum Queries  
- Range Minimum Queries  
- Range Updates with Lazy Propagation  

---

## Strategy
1. Understand the type of query: sum, min, max, or custom.  
2. Build the **Segment Tree** accordingly.  
3. Handle both **point updates** and **range updates** if required.  
4. Optimize queries with **Lazy Propagation** for efficiency.

## Learning Goals
- Apply Segment Tree knowledge to solve real problems.  
- Handle **range queries** and **range updates**.  
- Build confidence in implementing segment trees in contests.

## Next Steps
Tomorrow (Day 54), we will introduce **Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees)**.
