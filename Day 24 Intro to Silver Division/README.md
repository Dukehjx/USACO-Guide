# Day 24 – Introduction to Silver Division

Today you’ll begin the **USACO Silver Division** track.  
The Silver level introduces more advanced problem-solving with **efficient algorithms**, **sorting + binary search**, and **graph traversal**.

---

## 📌 What You'll Learn

- The differences between **Bronze** and **Silver**
- New skills required for Silver: binary search, prefix sums, sorting tricks, graph algorithms (DFS/BFS)
- How contest time management changes as problems become more algorithm-heavy
- Example starter problem to warm up

---

## 🥉 From Bronze to Silver

- **Bronze:** Brute force, simulation, greedy, basic sorting
- **Silver:** Efficient algorithms (O(N log N)), problem modeling, graph traversal, prefix sums, binary search, two-pointers

Key change: **Input sizes grow** (N up to 10^5). Brute force is no longer enough!

## 🧭 Strategy for Silver Problems

1. **Check constraints first.**
   - N ≤ 100 → brute force might work
   - N ≤ 10^5 → need O(N log N) or better
2. **Choose the right tool.**
   - Sorting + binary search
   - Prefix sums
   - Graph traversal (DFS, BFS)
3. **Practice reducing problems to known patterns.**

## 💡 Example

See [`example.cpp`](./example.cpp) for a warm-up problem solved with sorting and binary search.

## 🏋️‍♂️ Self-Test Problem

Try the self-test problem in [`problem.md`](./problem.md)!  
It will test your ability to transition from brute force (Bronze) to efficient solutions (Silver).
