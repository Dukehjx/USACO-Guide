# Day 58 – Greedy Algorithms (Gold Level)

## Overview
Today we explore **Greedy Algorithms** at the Gold level.  
Unlike simpler greedy problems, Gold-level greedy problems require **careful proof of correctness** and often involve **sorting + data structures**.

---

## Key Ideas in Gold-Level Greedy
1. **Exchange Argument** – Prove greedy choice leads to an optimal solution.  
2. **Sorting with Conditions** – Order tasks/intervals by custom rules.  
3. **Greedy + Data Structures** – Use priority queues, sets, or multisets to maintain optimal states.  
4. **Greedy with Binary Search** – Sometimes greedy decisions need verification with search.

## Example Problems
- Interval Scheduling with Weights (requires DP + Greedy thinking).  
- Minimizing Lateness in Scheduling.  
- Assigning tasks to workers with capacity constraints.

## Learning Goals
- Recognize Gold-level greedy problems.  
- Learn to justify greedy correctness.  
- Implement greedy with advanced data structures.

## Next Steps
Tomorrow (Day 59), we begin studying **Weighted Graph Algorithms**.
